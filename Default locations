1) Playbooks and Roles:-

  *) Playbooks are usually located in your project directory. There is no specific
     default location for playbooks.
  *) roles is located into within the "roles/" directory 

 2) Inventory:-

   *) The default inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts

 3) Configuration Files:-

    *) The default configuration file is named ansible.cfg. Ansible searches for it in the 
       following locations (in order):
        ./ansible.cfg (local directory)          ex:- ./ansible.cfg gk
       ~/.ansible.cfg (user's home directory)    ex:- ~/.ansible.cfg playbooks
       /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (system-wide)    ex:- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (system-wide)
                                                        remote_user = ansible_user
 4) Roles Path:-

    *) By default, Ansible searches for roles in the "roles/" directory relative to the playbook location.
    *) You can set the "roles_path" in your ansible.cfg to specify a different default location for roles.

 5) Module Library:-

   *) Ansible looks for modules in the default module library path, which is "/usr/share/ansible"/ (or)
      "/usr/share/ansible/ansible/" depending on the distribution.
   *) You can specify an alternative module library path using the "ANSIBLE_LIBRARY" environment variable.

 6) Vault Password File:-

   *)  The default location for the Ansible Vault password file is "~/.ansible_vault" in the user's home directory.
   *) You can set the "vault_password_file" option in your "ansible.cfg" to specify a different file.

 7) Cache Directory:-

   *) Ansible uses a cache directory for facts and other temporary data. The default location is usually
    "~/.ansible/tmp/."
  *) You can specify an alternative cache directory using the "local_tmp" and "remote_tmp" options in
    your "ansible.cfg."

 8) Enabling Networking logging and  read the logfile:-

    *) it is disabled by default. It can be enabled with the "ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH" and "ANSIBLE_DEBUG" options on the 
       ansible-controller, that is the machine running ansible-playbook.
    *)  Before running ansible-playbook, run the following commands to enable logging:-
          # Specify the location for the log file
             $ export ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH=~/ansible.log
          # Enable Debug
             $ export ANSIBLE_DEBUG=True
          # Run with 4*v for connection level verbosity
             $ ansible-playbook -vvvv ...
    *) After Ansible has finished running you can inspect the log file which has been created on the 
       "ansible-controller":
             less $ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH

 9) Enabling Networking device interaction logging:-

   *) The messages are logged in the file pointed to by the "log_path" configuration option in the Ansible configuration 
      file (or) by setting the "ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH".
   *) Before running ansible-playbook run the following commands to enable logging
        # Specify the location for the log file
         $ export ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH=~/ansible.log
   *) Enable device interaction logging for a given task
      - name: get version information
        cisco.ios.ios_command:
          commands:
          - show version
           vars:
         ansible_persistent_log_messages: True
   *) To make this a global setting, add the following to your "ansible.cfg file":
        [persistent_connection]
        log_messages = True
