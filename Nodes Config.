1) Assuming we have 3 remote nodes and 1 controller in this setup

*) creating Same users across all remote and contoller node
    $ sudo adduser [gk1]
    $ sudo adduser [gk2]
    $ sudo adduser [gk3]
    $ sudo adduser [gk4]

*) Creating password for all users which we added
     $ sudo pass *****
     $ sudo pass *****
     $ sudo pass *****
     $ sudo pass *****

*)  Now, assign administrative access to the account here a/c means [user]
      $ usermod -aG sudo [gk1]
      $ usermod -aG sudo [gk2]
      $ usermod -aG sudo [gk3]
      $ usermod -aG sudo [gk4]

 *) Setting up an SSH Key pair

   Enter the following command in the Ansible control node terminal
      $ ssh-keygen
    here enter the location for to save keypassphrase
     ex:- /home/ans/.ssh/id._rsa.pub

 *) Configuring an Ansible Host

    in your contoller node
     $ ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
     $ ssh-copy-id gk2@10.2.3.30
     press enter to establish the connection
     repeat the same step for all nodes communication


 *) Setting up the Inventory File

       $ sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
     Scroll to the bottom of the file to add new hosts and sort them into categories
          [category name]
       server_name ansible_host=[server_ip]
      ex:- [dev]
         server1 ansible_host=10.2.3.30
     then press -> Ctrl+X and then press -> Y to save the inventory file.

*) to verify inventory file

    $ ansible-inventory --list -y

*) Testing the Connection

    $ ansible all -m ping
        [or]
   $ ansible all -m ping -u root

2) to change default forks in ansible

  *) To change the default number of forks in Ansible, you can do so by modifying the "forks" configuration
     option in your Ansible configuration file (ansible.cfg). The forks option determines the maximum number
     of parallel tasks that Ansible will execute on target hosts. You can adjust this value according to the 
     capabilities of your control node and the performance of your target hosts.
  *) Here's how to change the default number of forks in Ansible
  *) Open or create the "ansible.cfg" file. You can typically find it in one of the following locations 
       ./ansible.cfg (local directory)
      ~/.ansible.cfg (user's home directory)
      /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (system-wide)
 *) Add (or) modify the forks option in the [defaults] section of the ansible.cfg file. For example, to set 
    the number of forks to 10:
       forks = 10
   Save the changes to the "ansible.cfg" file.
 *) Now, Ansible will use the specified number of forks as the default for parallel task execution. Keep in mind that
    the actual number of forks should be chosen based on the capabilities of your control node, the performance of your 
    target hosts, and any system resource constraints. Setting the number too high may overload your control node or the 
    target hosts, while setting it too low may result in slower execution of playbooks.
 *) You can also override the forks value on a per-playbook basis by using the "--forks" command-line option. 
      ex:-  $ ansible-playbook --forks 10 your-playbook.yml
 *) This allows you to adjust the number of forks for specific playbooks without changing the global default.


3) Creating custom Inventory files:-

   *) Upon installation, Ansible creates an inventory file that is typically located at "/etc/ansible/hosts"
   *)  access your home folder and create a new directory to hold your Ansible files
        $ cd ~
        $ mkdir ansible
   *) Move to that directory and open a new inventory file using your text editor of choice. use nano:
        $ cd ansible
        $ nano inventory 
   *) A list of your nodes, with one server per line, is enough for setting up a functional inventory file.
      Hostnames and IP addresses are interchangeable.
           203.0.113.111
           203.0.113.112
           203.0.113.113
            non_prod
  *)  you can use the "ansible-inventory" command to validate and obtain information about your Ansible inventory:
       $ ansible-inventory -i inventory --list
  *) To run Ansible commands with a custom inventory file, use the -i Flag
       $ ansible all -i inventory -m ping
  *) for playbook
       $ ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
