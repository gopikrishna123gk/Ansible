1) SSH Connection Issue:-

   Problem:- You're unable to SSH into your target hosts.
   Example:- When running an Ansible playbook, you encounter an SSH connection error.
   Troubleshooting:- Check your SSH configuration and try to manually SSH into the target host using the 
                     same credentials. Ensure that the target host's SSH server is running and reachable.

 2) Permission Denied Error:-

    Problem:- Ansible reports a "Permission denied" error.
    Example:- When running a playbook, you get a "Permission denied" error while trying to access a file on the target host.
    Troubleshooting:- Verify that the user running Ansible has the necessary permissions and, if required, use "sudo" to
                     elevate privileges.

 3) Host Unreachable:-

    Problem:- Ansible marks hosts as "UNREACHABLE."
    Example:- You run a playbook, and some hosts are reported as "UNREACHABLE."
    Troubleshooting:- Check network connectivity, firewall rules, DNS resolution, and SSH server status on the target hosts.

 4) Module Failure:-

    Problem:- A specific Ansible module is failing.
    Example:- The apt module reports an error while trying to install a package on a Debian-based system.
    Troubleshooting:- Review the module's documentation, check input parameters, and inspect the error message for details. It may
                     indicate the package name is incorrect.

 5) Variable Mismatch:-

    Problem:- Playbook variables are not set correctly.
    Example:- A playbook variable isn't having the expected value.
    Troubleshooting:- Verify that variable names match between your playbook and inventory (or) variable files.

 6) Syntax Error:-

    Problem:- Playbooks or inventory files have syntax errors.
    Example:- An error message appears when running a playbook, indicating a YAML syntax error.
    Troubleshooting:- Review the error message, which usually includes line numbers, and fix the syntax issue. For example,
                      fixing indentation errors.

 7) Inventory Host Not Recognized:-

    Problem:- Hosts are not being recognized in the inventory.
    Example:- Ansible doesn't detect hosts from your inventory file.
    Troubleshooting:- Double-check the inventory file for correct formatting, and make sure it's in the right location. Verify that 
                      hostnames (or) IP addresses are correctly defined.

 8) Performance Slowdown:-

    Problem:- Playbooks are running slowly.
    Example:- Your playbook takes a long time to execute.
    Troubleshooting:- Analyze the playbook for inefficiencies, consider limiting the use of "gather_facts", and use Ansible's parallelism 
                      options, like --forks, to speed up execution.

 9) Module Not Found:-

    Problem:- Ansible can't find a specific module.
    Example:- You get an error indicating that a module is missing.
    Troubleshooting:- Ensure that the module is installed on the target host, or check your "ansible.cfg" for the correct module paths.

 10) Task Ordering Issue:-

     Problem: Playbook tasks are running in the wrong order.
     Example: Tasks execute in an unexpected sequence.
     Troubleshooting: Review your playbook and ensure that tasks are correctly ordered. Use dependencies and notify to define task dependencies.

11) trying to install a services using ansible playbook but not connecting to remote hosts

  *)  Inventory Configuration Issue:-

      Suppose you have an inventory file named dev.ini with the following content
             [web_servers]
          web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.100
          web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
    If you run an Ansible playbook but it's not connecting to your remote hosts, ensure that the inventory file is accessible and properly
    specified using the -i option:
     $ ansible-playbook -i dev.ini gk-playbook.yml

 *)  SSH Key Authentication Issue:-

   *)  If you are using SSH key authentication, make sure your SSH key is added to the SSH agent. If your "SSH key is id_rsa", use the
       following command to add it
        $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

*)  Host Key Verification Issue:-

   *) If the remote host's SSH key fingerprint has changed, you'll need to update your known hosts. Use the following command to remove
      the old entry and re-verify the host:
       $ ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.100

*)  Firewall and Security Issue:-

  *) If you suspect a firewall issue, you may need to open the SSH port (default is 22) on your remote hosts. On Linux, you can use
    ufw to open the port:
      $ sudo ufw allow 22

*)  SSH Configuration Issue:-

   *) Check your SSH client configuration in your "~/.ssh/config file". Make sure there are no conflicting settings that might affect 
      Ansible's SSH connections.

 *)  Debugging Issue:-

   *) To enable verbose output for debugging, use the -vvv option when running your Ansible playbook:
         $ ansible-playbook -vvv your-playbook.yml    
   *) This will provide detailed information about the connection process and can help you identify the specific issue.

 *) DNS Resolution Issue:-

    Ensure that your control node can resolve the DNS names of the remote hosts. If DNS resolution is problematic, 
    use IP addresses in your inventory:
         [web_servers]
      web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.100
      web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.101

 *)  SELinux (or) AppArmor Issue:-

      On Linux, SELinux or AppArmor can sometimes interfere with SSH (or) Ansible. Check and adjust the security policies as needed.
