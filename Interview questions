1) What is Configuration Management?

   to systematically manage, maintain, and control the configuration of software,
   hardware, and infrastructure in a consistent and efficient manner it includes
      *) Consistent
      *) Documented
      *) Traceable
      *) Repeatable
      *) Compliant
   
2) How does Ansible work?

   Ansible is a combination of multiple pieces working together to become an automation tool. 
   Mainly these are modules, playbooks, and plugins.
   1) Modules:- these are small codes that will get executed. There are multiple inbuilt modules that 
                serve as a starting point for building tasks.
   2) Playbooks:- itcontain plays which further is a group of tasks. This is the place to define
                  the workflow or the steps needed to complete a process
   3) Plugins:- these are special kinds of modules that run on the main control machine for logging purposes.
                There are other types of plugins also.

3) features of Ansible?

   It has the following features:-
   *) Agentless :– Unlike puppet (or) chef there is no software (or) agent managing the nodes.
   *) Python :– Built on top of python which is very easy to learn and write scripts and one of the robust 
                programming languages.
   *) SSH :– Passwordless network authentication which makes it more secure and easy to set up.
   *) Push architecture :– The core concept is to push multiple small codes to the configure and run the action
                           on client nodes.
   *) Setup :– This is very easy to set up with a very low learning curve and any open source so that anyone 
               can get hands-on.
   *) Manage Inventory :– Machines’ addresses are stored in a simple text format and we can add different sources 
                          of truth to pull the list using plugins.

4) Explain Infrastructure as Code?

  *) it involves managing and provisioning infrastructure (e.g., servers, networks, storage, and other components)
     using code and automation. Instead of manually configuring and provisioning infrastructure.
  *) IaC allows you to define and maintain your infrastructure as code in a version-controlled format.


5) Explain Ansible galaxy?

   *) it is a web-based platform and community hub for sharing, finding, and collaborating on Ansible content.
   *) it provides a central repository and a set of tools to help Ansible users discover, reuse, and collaborate on
      these content resources.

6) Explain modules in Ansible?

    *) They are the building blocks of Ansible automation, allowing you to execute various operations, from system 
       configuration and package management to file manipulation and cloud resource provisioning.
    *) it simplify's the automation process by providing a consistent interface to manage different systems and services
    *) Ansible modules are a fundamental component of Ansible automation, enabling you to perform a wide range of tasks
       across your infrastructure efficiently and consistently.

7)  What are Ansible tasks?

    *) Ansible tasks are the individual units of work within an Ansible playbook. Each task defines a specific action
       (or) operation that Ansible should perform on the target system(s) when the playbook is executed.
    *) Tasks are executed in order, and they encapsulate the work required to achieve the desired state of the system,
       often using Ansible modules.

8) Ansible Playbooks vs Roles?

  *) Roles:-	
   1) Roles are reusable subsets of a play.	.
   2) A set of tasks for accomplishing a certain role.	
       Example:- webservers, group of servers	

*) Playbooks:-
   1) Playbooks contain Plays
   2) Mapps among hosts and roles.
      Example: site.yml, gkservers.yml, webservers.yml.

9)  advantages of using Ansible?

    The main advantages of using this tool are
      1) Agentless
      2) Very low overhead
      3) Good performance.

10) can we create reusable content with Ansible?

    Yes, Ansible has the concept of roles that helps to create reusable content
       here  role directory structure:-

my_roles/
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml
├── files/
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml
├── meta/
│   └── main.yml
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
├── templates/
├── tests/
├── vars/
│   └── main.yml
└── README.md

11) How to create a empty file in Ansible?

   *) To create an empty file, Ansible uses a file module.
   *) first we need to create a playbook with the name of this is_empty_file.yml
---
- name: this is an empty file
  hosts: dev_target_host
  tasks:
    - name: this is an empty file
      file:
        path: /path/to/dev/empty_file.txt
        state: touch
  *) run the playbook 
     $ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini this is_empty_file.yml
