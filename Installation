*) there are two types of machines

    1) Control machine :− Machine from where we can manage other machines.
    2) Remote machine :− Machines which are handled/controlled by control machine.

*) Control Machine Requirements

   1) Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2 (versions 2.6 or 2.7) (or) Python 3
     (versions 3.5 and higher) installed.
       Note :− Windows does not support control machine.
   2) By default, Ansible uses ssh to manage remote machine.
